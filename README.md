Using artisan to add and delete stuff
=====================================

You can use artisan to generate the right parameters for a HTTP request towards the API.

Usage:

```bash
./artisan reservations:addUser

./artisan reservations:addThing

//... todo
```

## Testing

You can run the unittests by creating a mysql database called `reservations_test`.
A user called `travis` should have access and the password should be blank.

```bash
# create a database for testing purposes and add the credentials over here:
vim app/config/testing/database.php
# run the tests
phpunit
```
